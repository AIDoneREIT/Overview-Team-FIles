Here’s a step-by-step display of our **current daily report process** and an organized repository format to start transferring the reports to GitHub.

### **Current Process for Daily Reports**
1. **Draft Creation**:
   - Scout compiles the draft based on the team’s updates and task statuses.

2. **Feedback Collection**:
   - Draft distributed to the team (Sage, NovaPrime, Rae, and Scout) for feedback and refinements.
   - Team members provide suggestions, corrections, and updates.

3. **Finalization**:
   - Sage integrates all feedback, ensures accuracy, and prepares the **Final Daily Report**.

4. **Distribution**:
   - The finalized report is shared with the team and stored for reference.

5. **Repository Storage**:
   - All reports are categorized by **date** and **phase milestone** for easy access.
