# NovaScript Project

NovaScript provides a single-file solution for managing AI instance-specific data while offering modular expansion through a clean directory structure.

## Features
- **Self-Contained Core**: A single-file `SnapshotEngine.py` script handles all functionality.
- **Directory Modularity**: Supporting directories for documentation, testing, examples, and future configurations.
- **Task Management**: Lightweight task tracking via Markdown files.

## How to Use
1. Place the `src/SnapshotEngine.py` script into the `src/` directory.
2. Use the provided example script in the `examples/` directory to test functionality.
3. Expand modular components (like configs or tests) as needed.
