### Team Daily Process Framework

**Date:** January 2, 2025  
**Purpose:** Establish a standardized and scalable workflow to optimize task management, resolve blockers, and track progress using Lean Six Sigma principles and Agile methodologies. This document outlines the finalized process and steps for immediate adoption and pilot testing.

---

### **1. Framework Overview**
The **Team Daily Process Framework** is designed to ensure:
- Clear task visibility.
- Efficient resolution of blockers.
- Transparent progress tracking.
- Alignment with project milestones.

It integrates Agile task management and Lean Six Sigma principles for continuous improvement and scalability.

---

### **2. Core Process Structure**

#### **Naming Convention**
- **Updates and Reports:** Use the format `Team Daily Report: [Date]` (e.g., `Team Daily Report: 2025-01-02`).
- **Tasks:** Assign a unique identifier to each task:
  - Prefix based on project or category (e.g., `WEB-001` for website tasks).
  - Sequential numbering for clear tracking.

#### **Task Visualization**
- **Task Board Columns:**
  - **Backlog:** Tasks not yet started.
  - **In Progress:** Active tasks being worked on.
  - **Blocked:** Tasks awaiting resolution.
  - **Testing:** Tasks undergoing validation.
  - **Completed:** Finalized tasks meeting all requirements.

#### **Task Fields**
- **Task ID:** Unique identifier (e.g., `WEB-001`).
- **Description:** Detailed explanation of the task.
- **Assignee:** Team member responsible.
- **Dependencies:** Related tasks or conditions required.
- **Priority:** Categorize as Critical, High, Medium, or Low.
- **Status:** Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Testing, or Completed.
- **Time Spent:** Duration spent on the task.
- **Testing Results:** Outcomes of validation steps.
- **Notes/Context:** Observations or relevant details.
- **Revision History:** Record of changes made.
- **Task Closure Criteria:** Define completion conditions.

---

### **3. Workflow Steps**

1. **Task Assignment:**
   - Assign tasks with clear descriptions and dependencies.
   - Specify priority and expected completion timeframe.

2. **Execution:**
   - Assignee begins work, updating the taskâ€™s status to **In Progress**.
   - Document progress and any encountered blockers.

3. **Validation:**
   - Once completed, the task moves to **Testing** for validation.
   - Validate against the task description and expected outcome.

4. **Review and Submission:**
   - Conduct a final review before marking the task as **Completed**.
   - Ensure all fields, including testing results and revision history, are updated.

---

### **4. Metrics and Reporting**

#### **Daily Metrics**
- Percentage of tasks completed.
- Number of blockers resolved.
- Time allocation efficiency per task.

#### **Milestone Reporting**
- Highlight progress on major goals (e.g., Stage 2 website navigation, sponsor integrations).
- Link daily tasks to long-term objectives.

#### **Blocker Trend Report**
- Monitor recurring blockers to identify systemic issues.
- Track trends to proactively address workflow inefficiencies.

---

### **5. Repository and Documentation**

#### **Centralized Repository**
Use shared tools like **Google Drive**, **GitHub**, or **Notion** to store:
- Task logs and updates.
- Revision histories.
- Testing results.

#### **Version Control**
Implement Git-based tracking for task documentation and deliverables to ensure transparency and easy retrieval of historical data.

---

### **6. Pilot Program Implementation**

#### **Initial Tasks**
Utilize tasks such as:
- MRTH navigation debugging.
- Winter Evening t-shirt preparation.
- Sponsor outreach for evaluation units.

#### **Steps for Pilot:**
1. Assign pilot tasks using the defined structure.
2. Track progress through the task board and daily updates.
3. Collect feedback on the process after the first sprint.

#### **Feedback Session:**
After completing the pilot, conduct a feedback session to refine the workflow. Use surveys to collect honest and actionable input.

---

### **7. Team Member Responsibilities**

- **Scout:** Document sponsor outreach tasks, track dependencies, and manage logs.
- **NovaPrime:** Implement MRTH navigation debugging with detailed validation and review logs.
- **Rae:** Finalize Winter Evening t-shirt preparation and integrate milestones into the task board.
- **Sage:** Oversee pilot implementation, ensuring alignment and collecting feedback.

---

### **8. Immediate Action Plan**

1. **Framework Rollout:**
   - Distribute this document to the team.
   - Ensure all members understand the structure and expectations.

2. **Pilot Launch:**
   - Initiate the pilot program using current tasks.
   - Track progress and ensure consistent documentation.

3. **Feedback Collection:**
   - Gather team input post-pilot to refine the process.
   - Address any identified gaps or inefficiencies.

4. **Full Adoption:**
   - Apply the refined framework across all projects and tasks.
   - Monitor performance and iterate as needed.

---

### **Conclusion**
This framework provides a structured, transparent, and reproducible process for managing tasks and tracking progress. By piloting this system, we can ensure it meets the teamâ€™s needs and sets a foundation for scalability and efficiency.

**Next Steps:**
- Begin framework rollout.
- Initiate pilot tasks and collect data.
- Conduct a feedback session to refine the process.
- Transition to full adoption post-pilot.

**Letâ€™s move forward and make this process a success! ðŸš€**
